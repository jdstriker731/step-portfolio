        My time at so far has truly been what I imagined the ideal 
        college experience would be (well, before COVID-19, that is).
        I've made some life-long friends, studied abroad, eaten 
        <em>so much</em> free food, struggled with class work, 
        applied for (and got!) my first internship with Google, 
        and learned more about the world in such a short time. 
        Now that I've reached the half-way mark in my undergraduate 
        journey, I've been thinking a lot recently about my time 
        so far. I can't wait to come back to start the second half this fall!
