        Hi! My name's Jonathan Dallard, but everyone just calls 
        me John or Johnny (I have no preference either way). I'm a 
        rising junior at Yale University majoring in Computer Science. 
        I grew up in Brooklyn but lived and went to high school 
        in Upstate New York. I got into programming just over 
        4 years ago and I've loved it ever since. My current interests 
        in CS revolve around web development,
        but I'm very interested in learning more about AI/machine 
        learning. When I'm not doing school or work-related things, 
        I'm usually watching anime (I'm a <strong>big-time</strong> 
        anime fan) or playing video games 
        (which I just got back into; I'm mainly playing Assassin's Creed).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though there's been a lot of changes to my STEP 
        internship, I'm really looking forward to this
        summer and working on my new projects with my team!
      </p>
