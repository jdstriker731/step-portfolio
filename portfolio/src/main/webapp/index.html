        Hi! My name's Jonathan Dallard, but everyone just calls me John or Johnny (I have no preference
        either way). I'm a rising junior at Yale University majoring in Computer Science. I grew up in 
        Brooklyn but lived and went to high school in Upstate New York. I got into programming just over 
        4 years ago and I've loved it ever since. My current interests in CS revolve around web development,
        but I'm very interested in learning more about AI/machine learning. When I'm not doing school or
        work-related things, I'm usually watching anime (I'm a <strong>big-time</strong> anime fan) or playing
        video games (which I just got back into; I'm mainly playing Assassin's Creed).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though there's been a lot of changes to my STEP internship, I'm really looking forward to this
        summer and working on my new projects with my team!
