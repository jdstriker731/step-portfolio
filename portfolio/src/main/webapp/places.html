      <h2>These maps show some of the places that mean most to me</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Home</h3>
      <div id="map-home"></div>
      <p>
        This is the first place I've ever called home. This is where 
        I grew up with my mom, grandma, grandpa, and (eventually) my 
        younger brother.

      <h3>Coney Island</h3>
      <div id="map-cisland"></div>
      <p>
        Coney Island was one of my favorite places to go to as a kid.
        My mom would take me there to ride the Cyclone and eat food from
        Nathan's Famous. I haven't been here in such a long time, and post-
        COVID-19, I will be going back for the first time with my friends.
      </p>

      <h3>Silliman College</h3>
      <div id="map-silliman"></div>
      <p>
        Silliman is one of the 14 colleges in the residential college system 
        at Yale. More than that, it has become my home since going awat for college. 
        So many of my favorite memories from the past two years occurred within 
        its walls. These include simply eating with my friends in the dinning 
        hall and laying out in the grassy courtyard on gorgeous weather days. 
        If I could go back in time somehow and choose my residential college again, 
        I would always pick Silliman.
